---

MAGDA is a free, open-source DAW with AI integrated from the ground up. Built on C++20, JUCE, and Tracktion Engine.

### Features

- **Hybrid tracks**: every track hosts both audio and MIDI clips
- **Three views**: Arrangement, Session, and Mix
- **AI chat**: natural language commands that generate and execute a custom DSL directly in the app (BYOAK, Bring Your Own API Keys)
- **Modulation system**: 16 LFOs (with bezier curve editor) and 16 macro knobs per device and rack
- **Racks**: parallel processing chains with volume, pan, mute, solo per chain, fully nestable
- **Piano roll** with pitchbend and MIDI CC lanes
- **Drum grid** device
- **Session view** with clip launching
- **Mixer** with faders, pan, mute, solo, sends, and I/O routing
- **Collapsible, resizable panels**: Inspector + AI Chat (left), Plugin Browser + Sample Browser (right), context-sensitive editor (bottom)

## Status

See [Issues](https://github.com/Conceptual-Machines/magda-core/issues) for known bugs and planned features.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, or Xcode)
- CMake 3.20+

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Conceptual-Machines/magda-core.git
cd magda-core

# Setup and build
make setup
make debug

# Run
make run
```

### Make Targets

```bash
make setup      # Initialize submodules and dependencies
make debug      # Debug build
make release    # Release build
make test       # Run tests
make clean      # Clean build artifacts
make format     # Format code
make lint       # Run clang-tidy analysis
```

## Automated Workflows

The project includes automated GitHub Actions workflows:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs on every push to validate builds and code quality
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis, secret detection, and vulnerability scanning
- **Periodic Code Analysis**: Weekly scans for TODOs, FIXMEs, and code smells
- **Refactoring Scanner**: Bi-weekly analysis of code complexity and technical debt

See [docs/AUTOMATED_WORKFLOWS.md](docs/AUTOMATED_WORKFLOWS.md) for details on automated analysis and periodic workflows.

## AI Providers

MAGDA supports local inference through `llama.cpp` and cloud-backed providers configured from `Settings > AI Settings`.

### Codex Integration

MAGDA includes a Codex cloud provider for users who authenticate with a ChatGPT account and want to use the Codex Responses backend directly from the app.

What the integration does:

- Adds a `Codex` provider in `AI Settings > Cloud`
- Supports browser-based OAuth login from the app
- Stores the resulting access token, refresh token, account id, and expiry in the MAGDA config
- Refreshes the access token automatically when needed
- Routes Codex requests through the Responses-style backend at `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`

### Codex Setup

1. Open `Settings > AI Settings > Cloud`
2. Select `Codex`
3. Click `Login`
4. Complete the browser login flow
5. After login succeeds, MAGDA automatically switches the active cloud preset to `Cloud (Codex)`

You can also override the provider `Base URL` and `Model` from the same page if needed.

### Supported Codex Models

The Codex provider is configured for Codex-compatible model ids, not standard OpenAI API chat model ids.

- `gpt-5-codex`
- `gpt-5.2-codex`
- `o4-mini`

Older values such as `gpt-5-mini` or `gpt-4o-mini` are normalized to Codex-compatible defaults when possible.

### Notes

- Codex requests use the app's cloud provider settings rather than per-agent API keys
- The Codex backend does not accept all official Responses API parameters, so MAGDA omits incompatible fields for this provider
- The `juce-llm` submodule contains the transport changes required for Codex-specific headers, payload shape, and streaming event parsing

## Security

MAGDA takes security seriously. The repository implements comprehensive security measures:

- 🔒 **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected with required reviews and status checks
- 🔍 **Automated Scanning**: CodeQL security analysis for C++ vulnerabilities
- 🔐 **Secret Detection**: Automated scanning to prevent credential leaks
- 🛡️ **Dependency Monitoring**: Dependabot for security updates
- ⚡ **CI/CD Security**: All security checks must pass before merge

**Found a security issue?** Please review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.

For detailed information about branch protection and security architecture, see [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md).
